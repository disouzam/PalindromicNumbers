# PalindromicNumbers
This repository contains code related to some exercises and experimentation around palindromic numbers

# References

The main reference to code produced here is this challenge in [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PALIN/) - The next palindrome. In folder Docs, there is a PDF document entitled [12050-PalindromeNumbers.pdf](Docs/12050-PalindromeNumbers.pdf) that presents the challenge description.

As other challenges were found in other Online Judge systems and new ideas were found in YouTube videos dedicated to these numbers, this repository will be a collection of projects, with their "realization" being made via console applications or maybe ASPNET Core websites or even MAUI apps - the easiest one will be the preferred channel to showcase the implementation.
